This is my first project dabbling with the PixiJS loop.

The skills I wanted to learn from this project were:
* Working with Sprite Sheets
* Writing a GameLoop()
* Using the PixiJS library
* Creating layered backgrounds with forground/middleground etc and moving clouds.

It is still a work in progress but the character can move left and right as jump and the background moves with her movement, which was my main goal.
